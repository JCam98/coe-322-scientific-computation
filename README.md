# Infectious Disease Simulation Project


## Description

The purpose of the Infectious Disease Simulation Project was to achieve a basic understanding of how an infection propagates through a population by running simulations under a variety of different conditions using object-oriented programming constructs.

## Academic Use Notice

This repository contains solutions developed as part of COE 322: Scientific Computation.
It reflects completed coursework and is intended for reference only. Current students should
not submit this work as their own.

This README file contains instructions on how to build executables from main programs and library used in exercises 1-5 for the Infectious Disease Simulation Project.

## User Guide for Executing Simulations

1) To run the simulation for Infectious Disease Exercise #1:

  a) <compiler> Infectious_Disease_Exercise_1.cc -o <executable>

2) Instructions on Building Executable for the source file: `Infectious_Disease_Simulation_Exercise_2.cc`:

-Link the object file entitled `Infectious_Disease_Simulation_Exercise_2.o` created from compilation of the source file `Infectious_Disease_Simulation_Exercise_2.cc` with the object file entitled `Infectious_Disease_Simulation_Library.o`

3) Instructions on Building Executable for the source file: `Infectious_Diseasse_Simulation_Exercise_3.cc`: 

-Link the object file entitled `Infectious_Diseasse_Simulation_Exercise_3.o` created from compilation of the source file `Infectious_Disease_Simulation_Exercise_3.cc` with the object file entitled `Infectious_Disease_Simulation_Library.o`

4) Instructions on Building Executable for the source file: `Infectious_Diseasse_Simulation_Exercise_4.cc`: 

- Link the object file entitled `Infectious_Disease_Simulation_Exercise_4.o` created from compilation of the source file `Infectious_Diseasse_Simulation_Exercise_4.cc` with the object file entitled `Infectious_Disease_Simulation_Library.o`

5) Instructions on Building Executable for the source file: `Infectious_Disease_Simulation_Exercise_5.cc`: 

- Link the object file entitled `Infectious_Disease_Simulation_Exercise_5.o` created from compilation of the source file `Infectious_Disease_Simulation_Exercise_5.cc` with the object file entitled `Infectious_Disease_Simulation_Library.o`
